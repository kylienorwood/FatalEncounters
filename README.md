# FatalEncounters
After my Introduction to Data Science for Social Science course in the Czech Republic, I decided to explore a topic heavy in the news - police brutality. There is an open source set of data on https://fatalencounters.org/ that I have been working with, but am still heavily exploring. My goal is to create visualizations for people to better understand the statistics on encounters with the police that end in fatalities.  I have, so far, created visualizations solely on count. For example, the number of fatalities based on race. However, I would like to compare the data proportionally (i.e. the proportion of Hispanic fatalities to the population of Hispanic in the U.S.) in order to inform others how easily statistics can be manipulated in order to fit someone's (such as a news source's) argument. Ongoing side project - so not heavily active.
